# paging-with-rxjava

This is the sample of paging library with retrofit and rxjava.

In this sample android paging library implemented with network call using retrofit and rxJava. This sample is available in both language Java and kotlin.

"Paging library"[https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/] used with RecyclerView with pagination. I have also implemented retry functionality that help us if we got network problem during loading of any page then it will request to server only that page.
